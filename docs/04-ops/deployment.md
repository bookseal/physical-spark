# Deployment & CD

How `physical-spark.bit-habit.com` ships, following the same pattern as the
other services on the bit-habit k3s box (`static-web`, `llm-app-lab`, …).

## TL;DR

Push to `main` → GitHub Actions SSHes into the server → the server pulls this
repo, restarts what needs restarting, and re-applies the k8s manifests. No
manual step.

```
git push origin main      # that's the whole deploy
```

**Kubernetes does not watch GitHub.** It only keeps a declared state true
("one Pod must be running"), so it restarts crashed Pods but will never notice
that you pushed. Something outside the cluster has to say "there is new code" —
here that is GitHub Actions. This trips up nearly everyone; there is no
in-cluster CD tool (no Flux/Argo) on this box.

You can also trigger it by hand from the repo's **Actions** tab
(`workflow_dispatch`), or run it directly on the box:

```
ssh bithabit ~/workspace/physical-spark-deploy.sh
```

## The CD pattern (shared across the cluster)

The box has **no in-cluster CD tool** (no Flux/Argo/Keel) and **no cron**.
Every service deploys the same way: a per-repo **GitHub Actions** workflow SSHes
into the server on push and triggers a `git pull`. There are two service shapes:

| Shape | Example | How a deploy applies |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Static site** — nginx serves a git checkout via a `hostPath` mount | `static-web`, `llm-app-lab`, **physical-spark site** | `git pull` = live instantly; no image build, no pod restart |
| **Built service** — a container image in the local registry `localhost:5000` | `bithabit-api`, `pr-auth` | `docker build` → `docker push` → `kubectl rollout restart` |

`physical-spark` is a **hybrid**: the site + playbook (`site/` + `viewer/`,
served by the `physical-spark` Deployment) **plus** a built auth service
(`auth/`, the `pr-auth` Deployment). One script handles both.

## What each kind of change costs

The deploy is fast because most changes need no build and no restart at all.

| You changed | What it takes | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `site/`, `docs/`, any `.md` | **nothing** — live on `git pull` | the Pod reads the checkout through a hostPath mount, so the files it serves *are* the repo |
| `viewer/server.py` | pod restart (~5s) | Python loads the code into memory at startup |
| `auth/` | image build + rollout (~1m) | it is a real container image in the local registry |
| `k8s/`, `auth/k8s/` | `kubectl apply` | applied on **every** deploy anyway (see below) |

## The pieces

### 1. `ops/deploy.sh` (in this repo — the real logic)

Runs **on the server**. It restarts the site Pod if `viewer/` changed, rebuilds
the auth image if `auth/` changed, and then applies the k8s manifests.

Manifests are applied **unconditionally**. `kubectl apply` is idempotent — an
unchanged manifest costs one `unchanged` line — and applying every time makes
the deploy **self-healing**: anything poked by hand in the cluster is reset to
what git says. The file, not the running cluster, is the source of truth. That
is the core idea behind GitOps tools, without installing one.

### 2. `physical-spark-deploy.sh` (on the server, `~/workspace/`)

A 4-line bootstrap, and nothing more:

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/workspace/physical-spark
before=$(git rev-parse HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo none)
git fetch origin -q && git reset --hard origin/main -q
exec ops/deploy.sh "$before"
```

Its path is pinned in `authorized_keys` and so cannot move — but by pulling
first and handing off to a script *inside the repo*, **the deploy logic itself
becomes deployable**. Change how deploys work by pushing, not by SSHing in.

`reset --hard` (not a merge) makes the checkout an exact mirror of `origin/main`
— a deploy target should never carry local drift. It also means **gitignored
files cannot exist on the server**, which is what keeps private context
(`CLAUDE.md`, transcripts) out of the public playbook for free.

### 3. `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (this repo)

Runs on push to `main`. Loads the deploy key and SSHes to the box. The command
it sends is ignored — see the forced command below.

### 3. The forced-command deploy key

A dedicated `ed25519` keypair scoped to deploys only:

- **Private key** → GitHub repo secret `DEPLOY_KEY` (used by the workflow).
- **Public key** → the server's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`, pinned so the key can
  *only* run the deploy script:

  ```
  restrict,command="/home/ubuntu/workspace/physical-spark-deploy.sh" ssh-ed25519 AAAA… physical-spark-ci-deploy
  ```

  `restrict` disables port/agent/X11 forwarding and PTY allocation. Even if the
  private key leaked, it can do nothing on the box except run this one deploy.

## Infra facts

- **Host:** `158.180.71.122` (SSH alias `bithabit`), single-node **k3s**,
  Traefik ingress.
- **DNS:** `*.bit-habit.com` is a wildcard → new subdomains resolve with no DNS
  change. **TLS:** wildcard `*.bit-habit.com` cert (`tls-secret`) covers them too.
- **k8s objects** (namespace `default`):
  - `deploy/physical-spark` + `svc/physical-spark-svc` — the landing page **and**
    the `/docs` playbook, both served by `viewer/server.py` in a stock
    `python:3.12-alpine` image over a hostPath mount of the checkout. No image
    is built: the server is pure stdlib. `READ_ONLY=1` makes its `/api/save`
    write endpoint answer `403` — **never remove it**, the endpoint has no auth
    and the site is public. The mount is `readOnly` at the kernel level too, so
    the two guards fail independently. Manifest: [`k8s/site.yaml`](../../k8s/site.yaml).
  - `deploy/pr-auth` + `svc/pr-auth-svc` — auth service. Manifests:
    [`auth/k8s/`](../../auth/k8s/). Auth data (SQLite) persists on hostPath
    `~/workspace/pr-auth-data`.
  - `ingress/physical-spark` — routes `/api/auth` + `/api/scores` → `pr-auth-svc`,
    everything else → `physical-spark-svc`. Same-origin so the auth cookie is
    first-party. Manifest: [`auth/k8s/ingress.yaml`](../../auth/k8s/ingress.yaml).

## Watching a deploy

`gh run watch` streams the run's step status live and refreshes until it finishes
(≈7s for a static-only change; longer when `auth/` rebuilds the image):

```console
$ gh run watch -R bookseal/physical-spark
✓ main Deploy to physical-spark.bit-habit.com · 29113072093
Triggered via workflow_dispatch less than a minute ago

JOBS
✓ deploy in 7s (ID 86429790717)
  ✓ Set up job
  ✓ Load deploy key
  ✓ Trigger server deploy
  ✓ Post Load deploy key
  ✓ Complete job
```

The step statuses (`✓`/`*`/`X`) update in place; add `--exit-status` to make the
command exit non-zero if the run fails (handy in scripts). If you didn't catch
it live, pass an explicit run id — grab the newest with
`gh run list --workflow deploy.yml --limit 1`.

To see **what the server actually did** — the deploy script's output — read the
log of the `Trigger server deploy` step (the forced command streams its stdout
back into the job):

```console
$ gh run view 29113072093 -R bookseal/physical-spark --log | grep "physical-spark updated"
… Trigger server deploy … physical-spark updated to 3a974eb at 2026-07-10T17:51:53Z
```

> Note: runs currently log a harmless warning that `webfactory/ssh-agent@v0.9.0`
> targets Node 20 (auto-run on Node 24). It doesn't affect the deploy; bump the
> action version when convenient.

## Runbook

**Rotate / revoke the deploy key**

```bash
# revoke: drop the pinned line from the server
ssh bithabit "sed -i '/physical-spark-ci-deploy/d' ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
# rotate: regenerate, then re-add the public key + reset the GitHub secret
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f deploy_key -N '' -C physical-spark-ci-deploy
gh secret set DEPLOY_KEY -R bookseal/physical-spark < deploy_key
```

**Auth didn't update?** It only rebuilds when `auth/` changed; force it with
`ssh bithabit "cd ~/workspace/physical-spark && docker build -t localhost:5000/pr-auth:latest auth/ && docker push localhost:5000/pr-auth:latest && sudo -n k3s kubectl rollout restart deploy/pr-auth"`.
